# Mushroom Classification using C4.5 Algorithm

## Overview

This repository focuses on the application of the C4.5 algorithm for mushroom classification. The dataset used for this study is referenced as "Mushroom Classification."

## Study Process

### a) Data Pre-processing

Before building the classifier model, extensive data pre-processing is performed. This includes handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and converting categorical attributes to a suitable format.

### b) Classifier Model with C4.5 Algorithm

The dataset is divided randomly into a 2:1 ratio using a random sampling method. The C4.5 algorithm is then employed to build a classifier model based on the training dataset.

### c) Classifier Performance Evaluation

The classifier's performance is assessed on the test set, and various performance measures are reported. This includes a Confusion Matrix, Predictive Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, and Recall.

### d) K-fold Cross Validation and ROC Curve

K-fold cross-validation is utilized with different values of k to validate the model robustness. An ROC curve is obtained, providing insights into the model's performance variation across different folds.

## Results

The results of the study offer valuable insights into the efficiency of the C4.5 algorithm for mushroom classification. The reported metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's predictive capabilities.
